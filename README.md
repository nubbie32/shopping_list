# shopping_list



Welcome to the Shopping list. This is actually a shopping cart design compared to a shopping list. This does not match my wireframe due to most of the functions i stated in my wireframe exceeded my understanding of how to write and use javaScript. Mentor Dawson said that my current project design was close enough to the original wireframe and he helped me design the current project. 

Instructions: 

1) Use the latest Visual Studio code

2) No downloads are required.


Features used in this project:

1) I made my own array with my shopping cart items.

2) I have persistent data using my local storage with my cart items and the email you enter

3) I validated an email with regular expression. With this i additionally added an Alert to identify when the email meets 
email requirements and the Alert will show up to inform the user when they have not entered a vailid email address.   


Sidenotes:

The clear cart button will remove all items you have purchased on the page. The checkout button was placed for visual design but is not set up yet due to time requirements for the javaScript that was needed for the page.
